# StrongPhrase.net
Use this site to create memorable, strong passphrases.

**[Create your passphrase on StrongPhrase.net â†’](https://strongphrase.net/)**

This tool is similar to [diceware](https://www.eff.org/dice), but generates phrases that are easier to visualize and remember.


## Examples 

| Diceware                                                             | **StrongPhrase.net**                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `shading deflected panorama`<br>(40 bits of entropy)                 | `evil juror obtains 300 thin moths`<br>(46 bits of entropy)                              |
| `country cradle barbecue predator`<br>(52 bits of entropy)           | `drunk niece and greedy goose clean tall book`<br>(58 bits of entropy)                   |
| `dyslexia glitter repossess glimpse unrobed`<br>(64 bits of entropy) | `emotional boxer and concerned virus acquire 45 smashed baskets`<br>(66 bits of entropy) |

\* *Entropy referrs to how many attempts would be required to guess the password.*

As you can see, our passphrases must be longer to achieve the same amount of entropy as diceware passphrases. However, they are easier to remember.


## Why passphrases
This [classic xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/936/) about passwords vs passphrases is a good summary of why passphrases are better than passwords.

## Calculating cracking strength profiles
Estimating the number guesses/session (aka: hashes/second) is challenging because the functions used to encrypt a password vary widely.

The folks at hivesystems.com have a great [table](https://www.hivesystems.com/blog/are-your-passwords-in-the-green) that shows the time it would take to crack a password based on the number of guesses/second. They've put a great deal of thought into their assumptions, so we will use the same assumptions: **hashed with bcrypt at a cost (aka: [work factor](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#using-work-factors)) of 32**.

This data is current as of 2024 and will need updated.

The site offers attack profiles:
|                             | Standard consumer hardware  | Best consumer hardware           | Nation state attacker (NSA, etc.) |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Hardware                    | RTX 4090                    | RTX 4090 x10 (or AWS A100 x16)   | A100 x10,000                      |
| Cost                        | $2,300                      | $64/hour for 2 AWS instances[^2] | $64,000/hour                      |
| Crack time for 8 chars [^1] | 99 years                    | 7 years                          | 5 minutes                         |
| Calculation                 | `= 70^8 / (99*365*24*3600)` | `= 70^8 / (7*365*24*3600)`       | `= 70^8 / (5*60)`                 |
| Guesses/second              | = 184,000/sec               | = 2.6 million/sec                | = 1.9 trillion/sec                |

This is a fork of [Get a Passphrase by Ryan Foster](https://github.com/openidauthority/getapassphrase). This repo is a significant re-write of the interface, while most of the core passphrase generation remains the same.
