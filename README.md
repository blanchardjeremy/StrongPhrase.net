# StrongPhrase.net
Use this site to create memorable, strong passphrases.

This tool is similar to [diceeware](https://www.eff.org/dice), but generates phrases that are easier to visualize and remember.


## Examples 

| Diceware                                                          | **StrongPhrase.net**                                                                  | 
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `shading deflected panorama` (40 bits of entropy)                 | `evil juror obtains 300 thin moths` (46 bits of entropy)                              |
| `country cradle barbecue predator` (52 bits of entropy)           | `drunk niece and greedy goose clean tall book` (58 bits of entropy)                   |
| `dyslexia glitter repossess glimpse unrobed` (64 bits of entropy) | `emotional boxer and concerned virus acquire 45 smashed baskets` (66 bits of entropy) |

Entropy referrs to how many attempts would be required to guess the password.

As you can see, StrongPassphrase.net passphrases must be longer to achieve the same amount of entropy as Diceware passphrases. But they are easier to remember.
